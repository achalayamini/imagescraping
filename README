OBJECTIVE OF THE SCRIPT:

The module webimages_downloader.py is written to download all the images present in a web page. The user needs to enter a URL to a web page. The script then parses through the URL and finds all the images on the page. The images are then downloaded on to a new folder. The links(URLs) to each of the images are stored on a file on the local directory.

ASSUMPTIONS MADE: 
I have asssumed that the user is allowed to give an input from the command line.
Images are downloaded as it is presented in the server(no-resizing is considered if renderred in webpage)
The file with the URL list is appended on every use of the script.
